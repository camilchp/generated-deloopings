# Delooping generated groups in homotopy type theory

This repository presents the developments accompanying the paper _Delooping
generated groups in homotopy type theory_ by Camil Champin, Samuel Mimram and
Emile Oleon. They have been tested with
[Agda](https://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/) 2.6.3 with the [cubical Agda
libraray](https://github.com/agda/cubical) version 0.5.
